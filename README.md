## üìï About

This website was created as a study challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Basically, this is a website where the user can input a born date, and then the website will calculate the age in years, months and days.

This was the first project that I developed using JavaScript. So my main objective with this challenge was to learn more about how to use JavaScript in a real project and also keep improving my HTML and CSS skills.
